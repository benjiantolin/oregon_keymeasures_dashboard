### Introduction
This is a dashboard of story maps that contains a sample of key measures from the [Oregon by the Numbers 2018 Edition](https://www.tfff.org/select-books/book/oregon-numbers) report.

The sample of key measures topics are as follows:

- Demographic
- Social
- Economic
- Education
- Health
- Infrastructure

This dashboard includes just a handful of the key measures provided by Oregon by the Numbers to further visualize the data using a dynamic online interface. The goal of Oregon by the Numbers is to get information to local community leaders and engaged citizens to encorage data driven decision making and data literacy.

This Oregon by the Counties story map further extends the vision by creating an online interactive platform to visualize and analyze the key measures for Oregon counties.

#### Preview
